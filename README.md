# Pipelines developed for the 1kg-ONT project

This repository contains the following pipelines:
* **graph-augmentation**: extends an existing minigraph pangenome graph by adding variant calls produced by different callsets
*  **prepare-SVarp-callset**: prepares a multi-sample VCF from given single-sample callsets

For further instructions, check out README files in these folders.
